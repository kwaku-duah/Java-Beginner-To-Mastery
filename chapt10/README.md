Exception handling in Java programming
Errors mainly come about in Java due to two main reasons:
Mishandled Exceptions and 
Memory Management!

However, breaking code is best  managed when the programmer can handle exceptions

Exception simply refers to an abnormal condition that occurs in a code sequence
 at runtime.
