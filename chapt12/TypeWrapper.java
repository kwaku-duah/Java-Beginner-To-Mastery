     * primitive(simple) data types made way for efficiency, performance-wise
     * however, they are not objects and do not inherit from objects
     * However, sometimes you may want to pass it a type reference, primitive
     * data types cannot, hence wrapping them to become objects become necessary
     * it is done with a static method value0f
     * the wrapper classes are Byte, Long, Short, Int, Float, Double, Character
     * and Boolean
     * to make them objects
     * static (wrapperClassType) valueOf(primitive data type ref-for-object-to-wrap)
     * to get the value from a wrapper class 
     * (primitive type) primitiveType+Value() e.g char charValue(), boolean booleanValue()
     * byte byteValue()
