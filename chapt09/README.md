visibility control mechanism
You can make classes within packages public to each other

Interface simply means point of contact between two or more objects
For example, methods are the point of contact for data in a class

Interfaces are special keywords that abstracts implementation away from interfaces

A class can implement one or more interfaces in contrast to a class implementing 
only one allowed superclass or abstract class
