## GENERICS
A solid understanding of generics is required in Java
it now allows creation of classes, interfaces and methods that work in a type-safe manner
with various kinds of data

With generics, you can define an algorithm once, independently of any type of data
to be used for all forms of data
Generics simply means parameterized types - writing code that works for any 
data type
