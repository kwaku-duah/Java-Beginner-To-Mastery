    /*access modifiers in java are basically public, private and
    protected which is only used during inheritance
     * public means that the member(code or data) is accessible to all codes
     * in the program(that same class, other classes, and even other packages
     * through importation)
     * private means the members are only accessible to other members of that 
     * same class
     * NB: there is a scenario where no access modifier is used, java defaults
     * to making those members public WITHIN ITS PACKAGE
     * package refers to a group of classes
